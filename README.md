My Dope Music - Template for a musical organizer
This is the product of a collaboration with Walyncia Brown and Pares Richardson during the Spring of 2020.
The intent of this website is to act as a streaming service for featured albums that have been made digital and to get information on the artists. 

September 2020 **EDIT**
Walyncia Brown full commit to migrate the html files to EJS to format implementing Node applications. 
The Index.js file listens through local host port 3000.
